    <h1>NotePix Calendar App</h1>

    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 31, 2025</p>

    <p>NotePix Calendar App is an app developed by Dixie Marielaput1, who I'll refer to as "I" or "the developer" in this text. I provide this service at no cost, and it's intended for use as is. This page outlines my policies regarding your information – how it's collected, used, and handled – when you use NotePix Calendar.</p>

    <p>Your privacy is my top priority. This Privacy Policy explains exactly how your information is handled when you use the NotePix Calendar mobile application.</p>

    <h2>My Core Principle: Your Data Stays on Your Device</h2>
    <p>NotePix Calendar is designed to be a private space for your thoughts, memories, and photos. I operate under a strict principle: <strong>your personal data and content never leave your device.</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>No Personal Information Collected by Me:</strong> I don't collect any personally identifiable information (PII) from you. This includes your name, email address, phone number, location, unique device identifiers, or any demographic information. You're completely anonymous to me.</li>
        <li><strong>All Your Content is Stored Locally:</strong> Any notes, text, images, or mood selections you create or add within NotePix Calendar are stored exclusively on your device's local storage (using AsyncStorage). This means your private content never resides on my servers or any third-party servers I control.</li>
        <li><strong>No Third-Party Tracking or Ads:</strong> NotePix Calendar doesn't contain any advertising libraries or third-party tracking code (like Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, or other similar SDKs). I don't collect usage data, track your activity within the app, or display any advertisements.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How NotePix Calendar Uses Your Information (Locally, and for AI)</h2>
    <p>Since all your data is stored on your device, its primary use is to enable the app's core functionality for you:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>App Functionality & Personalization:</strong> Your notes, text entries, attached images, and mood selections you create or add within NotePix Calendar are stored exclusively on your device's local storage. This data allows the calendar to mark days with content and provides a personalized journal experience.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Insight Feature:</strong> NotePix Calendar includes an AI insight feature that offers concise summaries or reflective prompts based on your daily notes. For this feature, the text of your daily notes is sent <strong>directly from your device to Google's Gemini API</strong> solely for the purpose of generating these insights. This communication occurs directly between your device and Google's API, meaning the data <strong>doesn't pass through or get stored on my (NotePix Calendar developer's) servers.</strong> Since I don't collect any personal information about you, the text sent to the Gemini API is <strong>unlinked from your personal identity.</strong> Google's own privacy policies and terms of service apply to their use of data through their APIs.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Permissions NotePix Calendar May Ask For</h2>
    <p>NotePix Calendar is designed to request only the permissions absolutely necessary for features you choose to use.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera and Photo Library Access:</strong> NotePix Calendar will ask for permission to access your device's camera and/or photo library only if you choose to attach an image to your daily entry. Any images you capture or select are then stored locally on your device within the app's data. I don't access, collect, or transmit these images to my servers or any third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Android's System Backup (Important Note)</h2>
    <p>You should be aware that your Android device might have a "Backup & Restore" or "Backup & Sync" feature enabled in your phone's system settings (often found under Settings / System / Backup / Back up my data). If this feature is active, Android (as part of your operating system, not NotePix Calendar) may periodically save a copy of your device's data, including app data (like your NotePix Calendar notes and images), to your Google Drive for recovery purposes. This allows you to restore your data if you get a new device or your current one is damaged.</p>

    <p>Please understand: As the developer of NotePix Calendar, I do not have access to this system-level backup data. This is a function of your Android operating system and your personal Google account.</p>

    <h2>External Links</h2>
    <p>NotePix Calendar may include links to external resources or information not part of this Privacy Policy. When you tap on these links within the app, they will open in your device's default web browser.</p>

    <p>Please be aware that any external sites you visit operate under their own privacy policies and terms, which I do not control.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>NotePix Calendar is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child has provided me with personal information, please contact me so that I can take appropriate action.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. I encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about my Privacy Policy or NotePix Calendar's data handling practices, please do not hesitate to contact me:</p>
